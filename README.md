This is a tech demo for Game AI Programming Course. The assignment was to design and create 3 different AI's that made use of 3 different types of movement. I decided to use A*, MoveTo and NavMesh as my 3 movements. Within the project, you can find seperate demo levels for each movement as well as a combined level showing all 3 working together.
